<h2>Creation & Development</h2>
<p id="description">
    Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series,
     the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man. 
     Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy,
      nerdy New York City high school student to a troubled but outgoing college student,
       then a married high school teacher, and, in the late 2000s, 
       a single freelance photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers.
        Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012â€“2014,
         following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die.[9]
         Marvel has also published comic books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man,
          including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara,
           the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of
           a teenage Peter Parker in the alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man,
            which depicts a teenager named Miles Morales who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man
             after Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later became a superhero in
              his own right and was brought into mainstream continuity, where he sometimes
               works alongside Peter.
